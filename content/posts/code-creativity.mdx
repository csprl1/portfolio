People often assume productivity and creativity live on opposite ends of the spectrum.

Structure vs freedom. Logic vs intuition.

But I’ve found they can coexist — if designed intentionally.

Instead of chasing balance, I built a rhythm.

## The 70 / 20 / 10 Rule

70% → Primary work  
20% → Creative exploration  
10% → Curiosity-driven experiments  

## Time Blocking Strategy

Weekdays → Deep technical focus  
Evenings → Creative play  
Weekends → Open-ended exploration  

Creativity doesn’t die under structure.

It thrives inside it.
