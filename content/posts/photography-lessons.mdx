For one full year, I committed to a simple rule:

Take at least one photo every single day.

No excuses. No perfectionism.

Some days offered dramatic light and perfect frames.

Most days didn’t.

That’s where the real lessons emerged.

## Photography Became About Noticing

• Subtle changes in light  
• Everyday compositions  
• Imperfect moments  
• Quiet details  

Consistency reshaped my eye more than talent ever could.

The camera didn’t just document my days.

It transformed how I experienced them.
