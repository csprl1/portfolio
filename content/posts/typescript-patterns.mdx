TypeScript didn’t just make my code safer.

It changed how I think about architecture.

Strong typing forces intentional design.

Over time, a few patterns became indispensable.

• Discriminated unions for state logic  
• Utility types for flexibility  
• Strict null checks for sanity  
• Inference-first design  

Good TypeScript is not about adding types everywhere.

It’s about modeling reality accurately.

Types are communication.
