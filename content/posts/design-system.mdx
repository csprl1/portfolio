Design systems are not just about components.

They are about decisions.

When we started building ours, the goal wasn’t visual consistency alone — it was scalability, clarity, and speed.

Early iterations revealed painful gaps.

• Consistency beats creativity at scale  
• Constraints improve design quality  
• Documentation is non-negotiable  
• Systems reduce decision fatigue  

A design system is a living product.

It evolves alongside the product it supports.
