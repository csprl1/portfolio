Side projects exist in a different universe.

No deadlines. No stakeholders. No pressure.

Just curiosity.

Some ideas fail quickly.

Some evolve into something meaningful.

## Why They Matter

• They keep creativity alive  
• They sharpen problem-solving  
• They remove fear of failure  
• They reconnect you with curiosity  

Not every project needs to scale.

Some projects just need to exist.
